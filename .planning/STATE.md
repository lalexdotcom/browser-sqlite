## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stay with Rstest for unit tests (consistent with build pipeline)
- Add Playwright for integration tests (only way to test Web Workers + OPFS in a real browser)
- Fix bugs before writing tests (bugs make tests validate wrong behavior)
- Author `wa-sqlite.d.ts` manually (no upstream declarations available)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `@lalex/promises` is missing from `package.json` — BUG-04 must be resolved before any code importing `client.ts` can be tested
- COOP/COEP headers must be configured on the integration test server — without them `new SharedArrayBuffer()` throws a `SecurityError`
